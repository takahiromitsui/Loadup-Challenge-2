# LoadUp App Mock

In this challenge, I aimed to mock a LoadUp App. Given the limited time, it was not realistic to implement all components and pages from the design.

## Scope of Work
I decided to focus on two main pages:
1. **Root Page** -> Including all functionalities
2. **Client Page** -> Partially implemented

## Library
- **Chakra UI**: To mock up UIs on the original LoadUp App.



## How to Run the Application
1. Install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install  
# or  
yarn install  
# or  
pnpm install  
# or  
bun install  
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
3. Check http://localhost:3000  
## Project Structure
The project structure follows the standard Next.js application setup, so no detailed explanation is necessary.
